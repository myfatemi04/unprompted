# unprompted
A prompt engineering library.

Start using GPT-3 and other language models for structured inference today.

# Installation

`pip install -e .`

# Usage

0. Set the OpenAI API key with `prompting.set_api_key`.
1. Create a `prompting.Prompt` object. This takes in one argument: the template, or skeleton for the prompt.
2. Call the `Prompt` object like a function, using keyboard arguments for variables you want to specify. This returns a `(completion, output_values)` tuple.
3. Use the `completion` and `output_values` how you please.

In the prompt, anything enclosed in curly brackets (`{}`) will be treated as a variable. These can be specified with keyboard arguments when calling the prompt, but if they are left unspecified, they will be generated with the language model backend (currently, GPT-3).

Variables are specified in the format `{variable name: variable type}`.

Right now, this API supports three variable types:
* `line`: value is generated by GPT-3 until the `\n` character is encountered (one newline).
* `multiline`: value is generated by GPT-3 until the `\n\n` sequence is encountered (two newlines).
* `list of [min-max]`: values are generated by GPT-3 as a bulleted list, repeating until at least `min` values are present and clipping after `max` values are found.

## Example

Prompt:

```
Today, we are announcing a new invention: the {invention_name}!

Here are some of its capabilities:
{capabilities: list of 3-5}

Motto of the invention: "{motto}"

Some hashtags to share this on social media:
{hashtags: list of 4}
```

The output values from calling `prompt(invention_name="self-solving Rubik's cube")` might be:

```json
{
	"capabilities": [
		"Automatically solve any Rubik's Cube in just seconds",
		"Self-learning algorithms to recognize and solve even the most difficult puzzles",
		"No need to use any external tools, just rotate the cube to solve it",
		"A simple, intuitive design that's easy to use"
	],
	"motto": "Solve the Rubik's Cube without breaking a sweat!",
	"hashtags": [
		"#SelfSolvingRubiksCube",
		"#RubikSolution",
		"#RubiksCubeRevolution",
		"#SolveAnyPuzzle"
	]
}
```

### Python implementation

```python
>>> prompt = Prompt("""
Today, we are announcing a new invention: the {invention_name}!

Here are some of its capabilities:
{capabilities: list of 3-5}

Motto of the invention: "{motto}"

Some hashtags to share this on social media:
{hashtags: list of 4}""".strip())
>>> full_text, variables = prompt(invention_name="self-solving Rubik's cube")
>>> variables

{
	"capabilities": [
		"Automatically solve any Rubik's Cube in just seconds",
		"Self-learning algorithms to recognize and solve even the most difficult puzzles",
		"No need to use any external tools, just rotate the cube to solve it",
		"A simple, intuitive design that's easy to use"
	],
	"motto": "Solve the Rubik's Cube without breaking a sweat!",
	"hashtags": [
		"#SelfSolvingRubiksCube",
		"#RubikSolution",
		"#RubiksCubeRevolution",
		"#SolveAnyPuzzle"
	]
}

>>> full_text
